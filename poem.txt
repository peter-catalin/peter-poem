Whispers of Dawn

The morning light breaks through the night,
Painting the sky in gold and white,
While shadows dance and slowly fade,
As nature's symphony is played.

The gentle breeze carries dreams away,
Of yesterday and hopes of today,
Through leaves that rustle soft and low,
In rhythms that the heart will know.

Each moment holds a precious gift,
Like clouds that in the heavens drift,
And though the day may come to end,
New dawns will always rise again.

So pause and breathe the morning air,
Feel grateful for the world we share,
For in each sunrise we can see
Life's endless possibility.
